# Hack.lu 2016

Hack.lu a 24h CTF contest that I was attending after the HitCon. It was challenging for me due to the fact that it was during the week (Wednesday 10:00 UTC - Thursday 10:00 UTC).

Again during this CTF I was playing with the Dragons (Dragon Sector team).
I've attempted to solve two tasks and managed to get the flag for one of them. I've also learnt a lot in terms of how to approach tasks. The team end up on 7th place collecting 1918 points. So it was quite ok I guess. Let's begin.

# simple-pdf (PPC 150)

This was quite a large (~30M) pdf file that showed Test123 when you opened it. A closer inspection with [peepdf](http://eternal-todo.com/tools/peepdf-pdf-analysis-tool) showed that it contained another pdf file inside.
![](content/images/2016/10/Zrzut-ekranu-2016-10-22-o-14.17.15.webp)
So the first thing I did was to extract the EmbeddedFile with `peepdf`. The file was a bit smaller then the original one and was also containing an embedded file so I was suspecting a матрёшка (so file inside a file, inside a file and so, so). The metadata of the file suggested there was 10000 iterations so there was no way doing it manually and finishing within the time limit of the CTF. So I took a scripted approach which `peepdf` supports. By creating a simple script
[code]
    stream 6 > 6.pdf
[/code]

that will be passed to the tool. A simple execution worked quite well so I put this into the batch file
[code]
    #!/bin/sh

    for i in {1..10000}
    do
      echo "Run $i"
      peepdf_0.3/peepdf.py -s unpack.script simple.pdf
      if [ $? -eq 0 ]
      then
         mv 6.pdf $i.pdf
         cp $i.pdf simple.pdf
      else
        exit
      fi
     done

[/code]

but there was a problem with such approach as it still took too long to extract a file. I suspect each time `peepdf` was loading a file it was analyzing it and that was taking the precious seconds. I started working on an in memory extracted to speed things up another team member extracted the last матрёшка-file with a `binwalk` script using `-M` option. I didn't even knew that `bin walk` can do it. Nice...

Lesson learnt: `peepdf` is a nice tool when you want to analyze a file and learn about its content but due to the analysis phase it's useless to quickly extract content repeatedly. Use the right tool for the job!

# Cornelius1 (crypto 200)

In this task we were given a server source code
[code]
    require 'openssl'
    require 'webrick'
    require 'base64'
    require 'json'
    require 'zlib'
    require 'pry'

    def encrypt(data)
      cipher = OpenSSL::Cipher::AES.new(128, :CTR)
      cipher.encrypt
      key = cipher.random_key
      iv = cipher.random_iv
      cipher.auth_data = ""
      encrypted = cipher.update(data) + cipher.final
      return encrypted
    end

    def get_auth(user)
      data = [user, "flag:"+File.read("flag.key").strip]
      json = JSON.dump(data)
      zip = Zlib.deflate(json)
      return Base64.strict_encode64(encrypt(zip))
    end

    class Srv < WEBrick::HTTPServlet::AbstractServlet
      def do_GET(req,resp)
        user = req.query["user"] || "fnord"
        resp.body = "Hallo #{user}"
        resp.status = 200
        puts get_auth(user).inspect
        cookie = WEBrick::Cookie.new("auth", get_auth(user))
        resp.cookies << cookie
        return resp
      end
    end

    srv = WEBrick::HTTPServer.new({Port: 12336})
    srv.mount "/",Srv
    srv.start
[/code]

and by quickly examination of it, we can see that the flag is added to the cookie along with user name provided by us and all is returned to us. It is encrypted before doing that of course.

But maybe we can somehow gain the knowledge about the flag? For sure we can. The problem here is that data is compressed before being encrypted and the algorithm that is used is [deflate](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1951). Why is that bad? Well if we can match data that we pass through the `user` parameter with the actual flag, we can influence `deflate` algorithm. It will detect the repeated data in the string and the result will be shorter then if there would be no repetition. We can use this behavior to obtain the flag. By brute-forcing the flag char-by-char we can get it.
[code]
    import base64
    import string

    from urllib2 import Request, build_opener, HTTPCookieProcessor, HTTPHandler, quote
    import cookielib
    cj = cookielib.CookieJar()

    opener = build_opener(HTTPCookieProcessor(cj), HTTPHandler())

    for char in xrange(0x20, 0x7f):
    	pref = 'flag:'
    	url = "https://cthulhu.fluxfingers.net:1505/?user="+quote(pref+chr(char)+'')
    	req = Request(url)
    	print pref+chr(char)+'',
    	f = opener.open(req)
    	cookie_val = cj._cookies['cthulhu.fluxfingers.net']['/']['auth'].value
    	decoded = base64.b64decode(cookie_val)

    	print len(decoded)

[/code]

and when we follow the process couple of times we get the full flag

which was: `Mu7aichede`. Quite a nice task.
